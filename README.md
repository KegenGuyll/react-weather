# Weather App

A simple and user-friendly web application to check current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any location.

## Features & Requirements:

### 1. **User Location Detection:**
- Automatically detect the user's location using the browser's geolocation API upon visiting the app.
- If the user denies access or if geolocation fails, provide an option for them to manually enter their city or location.

### 2. **Display Current Weather:**
- Show the current temperature, weather condition (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy), humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon.
- Allow for a toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### 3. **5-Day Weather Forecast:**
- Display a 5-day forecast with the expected high and low temperatures, weather conditions, and icons for each day.
- Users should be able to click on a specific day to get a more detailed hourly forecast.

### 4. **Responsive Design:**
- Ensure the app is mobile-responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.
- Consider using a library like `styled-components` or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.

### 5. **Error Handling & User Feedback:**
- Provide feedback to the user if there's an issue fetching the weather data, such as if their location is not found or if there's a problem with the API.
- Display a loader or a spinner while fetching the data to indicate that the app is working.

### **Bonus (Optional):**
- **Night Mode:** Implement a dark mode or night mode toggle for users who prefer a darker theme, especially during the evening or in low-light conditions.
